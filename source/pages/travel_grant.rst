Travel Grant 
=============

We collaborate with ICA through the organising commissions (LBS, CogVis and NMA) and we are happy to announce that we are able to provide
two travel grants to young researchers for attending the LBS 2025 conference. The granting criteria by the commissions are:

- accepted submission,
- fit of the submission topic with the scope of the conference,
- originality of the submission,
- quality of presentation in the submission.

To apply, send following documents to CogVis commission chair, Dr. Pyry Kettunen at pyry.kettunen@nls.fi:

- applicant name, postal address, e-mail, CV, birth year, affiliated institution, publication list,
- form of participation: in-person,
- a short 150-word statement explaining how they meet the criteria, why ICA should award the applicant and what benefit they expect to gain from the scholarship,
- proof of the applicant’s most recent year’s education or degree,
- letter of support from the ICA National Delegate (find at `icaci.org/national-members <https://icaci.org/national-members>`__) of the respective current country of residence and/or the current affiliate institution of the applicant.

Deadline to apply for grants is 31st March 2025. Results of the selection process will be communicated by email by 6th April.
Note that priority will be given to PhD/MSc/BSc students with an accepted submission. Each travel grant will be 500 EUR
(or €750 when the applicant is from a member nation with a developing economy).

Payments of grants will be made after the attendance at the conference.
