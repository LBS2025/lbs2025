All conference participants are warmly welcome to both of these events for free. Detailed information about the side-events can be found from the event websites.

Data-driven Mobility Analytics Workshop
---------------------------------------

The urgency of addressing urban sustainability and climate change has never been greater, with cities facing increasing pressure to provide equitable, low-carbon mobility solutions. Transportation is a important factor in both environmental sustainability and social equity, yet cities often struggle to integrate data-driven approaches that optimize mobility while reducing emissions and improving accessibility. This workshop, the first of two, is motivated by the need to bridge this gap by fostering collaboration between experts in geospatial data analytics, transport modeling, and sustainable mobility. By bringing together researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders from around the world, our aim is to broaden the conversation on current analytical tools, toolkits, and methods that support informed decision-making in sustainable transport planning.

Beyond technical discussion, the workshop will emphasize knowledge-sharing and capacity building, ensuring that emerging mobility analytics methods are accessible to a broad audience, including students and policymakers. These workshops will not only facilitate the co-creation of an open-source analytics toolkit but also cultivate long-term international partnerships that extend beyond the project’s duration. By leveraging regional expertise and data resources, we aim to lay the groundwork for scalable, climate-adapted mobility solutions that can be applied across diverse urban contexts. Through hands-on training, collaborative discussions, and applied case studies, participants will gain valuable insights into sustainable mobility analytics and contribute to shaping the future of data-driven transportation planning.
